## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (gh) - Required for triggering workflows
  - Install from: https://cli.github.com/manual/installation
  - Authenticate with: `gh auth login`

### GitHub Actions

Use the [setup-catalyst](https://github.com/PraveenGongada/setup-catalyst) action in your workflows to install Catalyst:

```yaml
- name: Setup Catalyst
  uses: PraveenGongada/setup-catalyst@v1
  with:
    version: 'latest' # or specify a version like 'v1.0.0'

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap PraveenGongada/tap
brew install catalyst
```

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/PraveenGongada/catalyst/cmd/catalyst@latest
```

### Linux

```bash
# Download the latest release (replace X.Y.Z with actual version)
curl -L https://github.com/PraveenGongada/catalyst/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/catalyst_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -o catalyst.tar.gz

# Extract the binary
tar -xzf catalyst.tar.gz

# Move to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv catalyst /usr/local/bin/
```

### Manual Installation

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/PraveenGongada/catalyst/releases).

## üîß Configuration

Catalyst uses a YAML configuration file to define your matrix configurations. By default, it looks for `catalyst.yaml` in the current directory.

### Configuration File Location

Catalyst looks for the configuration file in the following order:

1. Path specified with the `-config` flag
2. Path set in the `CATALYST_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `./catalyst.yaml` in the current directory
4. `$USER_CONFIG_DIR/catalyst/catalyst.yaml` (e.g., `~/.config/catalyst/catalyst.yaml` on Linux)

### Adding to Your Shell Profile

Add the following to your `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or equivalent:

```bash
# Set the path to your catalyst config
export CATALYST_CONFIG="/path/to/your/catalyst.yaml"
```

### Sample Configuration

Here's a simplified example of a configuration file:

```yaml
# GitHub workflow metadata
github:
  repository: "your-org/mobile-apps"
  workflows:
    ios_debug:
      name: "iOS Debug Workflow"
      file: "ios_debug.yml"
    ios_prod:
      name: "iOS Production Workflow"
      file: "ios_prod.yml"

# Dynamic inputs that can be referenced in matrices
inputs:
  version:
    description: "App version"
    required: true
    default: "1.0.0"

# Matrix configurations
matrix:
  MyApp:
    ios:
      Debug:
        workflow: "ios_debug"
        matrix:
          bundle_id: "com.example.myapp.debug"
          version: "{{inputs.version}}"
      Prod:
        workflow: "ios_prod"
        matrix:
          bundle_id: "com.example.myapp"
          version: "{{inputs.version}}"
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run Catalyst from your terminal:

```bash
catalyst
```

Or specify a custom configuration path:

```bash
catalyst -config /path/to/your/catalyst.yaml
```

Check the version:

```bash
catalyst -version
```

### Matrix Extraction

Catalyst provides a powerful matrix extraction feature that allows you to generate the exact matrix configurations without going through the interactive interface. This is particularly useful when you want to:

- **Use GitHub UI**: Extract matrices and manually trigger workflows through GitHub's web interface
- **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate Catalyst configurations into automated pipelines
- **Debugging & Validation**: Inspect matrix configurations before deployment
- **Flexibility**: Maintain consistent configurations while choosing your preferred trigger method

Extract matrices for a specific workflow:

```bash
# Extract as JSON (default) - perfect for GitHub workflow inputs
catalyst -extract ios_dev

# Extract as YAML for better readability
catalyst -extract android_prod -format yaml

# Use with a custom config file
catalyst -config /path/to/config.yaml -extract ios_prod
```

This approach ensures that whether you use Catalyst's TUI, the extraction feature, or any other method, your deployments remain consistent and follow the same configuration patterns defined in your `catalyst.yaml` file.

## üìã GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

To use Catalyst with your GitHub Actions, you need to set up a repository dispatch event in your workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/example.yml
name: Example Deployment Workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      payload:
        description: "JSON payload containing matrix configurations"
        required: true
      change_log:
        description: "Changelog for this deployment"
        required: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Parse the matrices JSON from the payload
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include: ${{ fromJson(fromJson(inputs.payload).matrices) }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Add your deployment steps here
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- Git

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/praveengongada/catalyst.git
cd catalyst

# Build the binary (main is in cmd/catalyst)
go build -o catalyst ./cmd/catalyst

# Run the application
./catalyst
```

### Making a Release

Catalyst uses GoReleaser to automate the release process:

1. Update the version in your code
2. Create and push a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and publish the release
